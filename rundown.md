#Rundown of project

General idea: To recreate a hospital sort of setting that artificially treats patients that are entered in the system.
It will revolve around the sometimes unpredictable odds of survival when people are injured, as well as implement a
priority process to treat those patients that need more “attention” and need to be treated first. Hospitals have those
rare cases where something goes wrong and patients suddenly pass away do to either an unpredictable outcome, or a
mistake on the hospital’s part. So that is something that we will try to implement into our program.

This project will be a program that uses data structures to sort and rearrange data to suit the basis of the idea. The
idea being a program that takes in any desirable amount of inputs (patient name and their level of severity) and puts
the worst severity level in front of priority to be treated. Once these patients are sorted by severity, the program
will then prompt the user to ask if they want to treat the patients, and if they do, then the program will run through
the patients and basically decide if they live or not based on unpredictable odds. The user basically plays the role of
a doctor in their job of putting data into a system for them to later be treated.
